Pipeline to extract DuckDuckGo Tracker Radar data and convert it into a structured JSON file for further use.

## Description

This repository automates the extraction of tracker data from the [DuckDuckGo Tracker Radar](https://github.com/duckduckgo/tracker-radar) and converts it into a single, organized JSON file. The pipeline runs as a weekly cron job and automatically syncs the updated data to the [detecta extension](https://github.com/leolivi/detecta) repository.

## Features

- Reads all JSON files from the `tracker-radar/domains` directory.
- Extracts relevant fields: domain, owner, categories, prevalence, and fingerprinting.
- Sorts and compiles the data into a structured JSON output (`dist/tracker.json`).
- Runs automatically on a weekly schedule.

## Usage

To run the pipeline locally:

```zsh
npm run extract
```

After execution, the extracted data will be available in `dist/tracker.json`.

## Project Structure

```

```

## Automated Workflow

The pipeline runs automatically every Monday at 9 AM UTC:

1. Clones the latest DuckDuckGo Tracker Radar data.
2. Runs `extract.js` to generate `dist/tracker.json`.
3. Copies the updated file to the [detecta extension](https://github.com/leolivi/detecta).
4. Commits and pushes changes if data has been updated.

**Manual trigger:** Available via GitHub Actions workflow dispatch.
